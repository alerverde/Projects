# Portfolio Projects

Welcome! This GitHub repository showcases a collection of my personal projects across business intelligence, machine learning, SQL, and scientific computing.

Each project highlights different aspects of my technical skillset â€” from dashboard design and DAX in Power BI, to building neural network models and writing efficient SQL queries, to performing simulations with Jupyter and Python.

---

## Power BI
- [Power BI](./Power-BI)  
  A 3-page interactive Power BI report featuring KPIs, customer segmentation, time intelligence, and a star schema model. Includes advanced DAX and custom date table logic.

---

## Machine Learning
- [ML in Supercooled Water](./ML-in-Supercooled-Water)  
  Neural network models to classify structural states of supercooled water using 3D molecular data. Includes model evaluation, data preprocessing, and visualization.

---

## SQL
- [MySQL Exploration](./MySQL)  
  Querying and analyzing structured retail datasets using MySQL. Focus on joins, aggregations, and creating insights from raw transactional data.

---

## Jupyter Notebooks
- [Jupyter Projects](./Jupyter-Projects)
  - [Boltzmann Distribution](./Jupyter-Projects/BoltzmannDistribution)  
    Simulation and visualization of Boltzmann energy distributions using NumPy and Matplotlib.
  - [Ski Hotels](./Jupyter-Projects/Ski-Hotels)  
    Data analysis of hotel bookings using pandas and Seaborn. Includes exploratory data analysis and basic visual insights.
  - [Chemical Physics Lab](./Jupyter-Projects/Chemical-Physics-Lab)  
    Lab-style notebooks exploring chemical physics concepts with simulation and plotting tools.
